            <h2>Case Study: RoboSimian in Earthquake Response</h2>
            <p>NASA’s RoboSimian robot was used during the 2015 earthquake in Nepal to assist in searching for survivors in hard-to-reach areas. It demonstrated the power of multi-limbed robots in maneuvering through unstable, debris-filled environments. RoboSimian’s flexibility allowed it to navigate rubble and confined spaces with ease, providing vital data and insight to first responders.</p>

            <h2>Case Study: UAV Aerial Drone in Disaster Response</h2>
            <p>Drones have become an invaluable tool in disaster zones, providing aerial assessments after earthquakes, floods, and wildfires. In 2017, UAV drones were used in Puerto Rico to survey the damage after Hurricane Maria. Their ability to provide real-time data on infrastructure, flooding, and survivor locations greatly sped up relief efforts.</p>

            <h2>Case Study: Spot Robot in Search and Rescue</h2>
            <p>Spot, by Boston Dynamics, has been deployed in various search and rescue missions, including after natural disasters and in hazardous environments. In one notable example, Spot was used in a collapsed building to assess the environment before human rescuers entered. Its ability to maneuver over rubble and provide real-time data made it an indispensable asset in the field.</p>
